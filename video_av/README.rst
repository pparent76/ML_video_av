video_av
=============

Select Av value, and have the machine adjust ISO and Tv while you are shooting a video.
(Usefull for cameras that do not have built-in video av mode e.g 500D,550D)

IMPORTANT: This modules require that you enable magic lantern's expo override and canon auto-exposure!

This module being based on Canon AE you keep all the features of canon auto-exposure: Exposure lock(*), 
Manual exposure compensation. On 500D Canon auto-exposure is triggered by pushing half-shutter for a duration
that you can set in Canon's menu. To have an almost permanent auto-expo without maintaining the shutter pressed
set "measure delay" to 30 min in Canon's menu.

You can enable or disable smoothing exposure changes. There is a small theoretical risk that setting smooth changes, 
may produce rare glitches during transitions. In order to make this risk inexistant, it's recommended to disable ML global draw,
disable energy saving, and use a fully charged battery.

You can select Av value from menu and it will only be applied when leaving menu, allowing 
to do only one physical apperture change instead of needing to go physically through all
intermediaries values like in standard ML exposure menu.
